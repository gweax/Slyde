            <p>
                Slyde is a web based presentation tool that uses advanced technologies like HTML5 and CSS3.

            <h1>Transitions</h1>
            <p>
                There are several effects to switch from one slide to another. Try changing the class name of the body
                element.
            </p>

            <h1>Transitions - CSS only</h1>
            <p>
                CSS3 is a cool way to allow for transition effects. There is no Javascript involved in that part. However,
                for more fancy effects, some Javascript might be required.
            </p>

            <h1>Navigation</h1>
            <p>
                The navigation elements on the slides are generated automatically. Therefore, you do not have to adapt every
                slide if you want to insert a new slide between existing ones.
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h1>Key navigation</h1>
            <p>
                You can navigate through the slides either by using the generated link elements or by using the keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try the Page Down, Page Up, Home and End keys as well as the left and right arrow keys.
            </p>

            <h1>Linking to a specific slide</h1>
            <p>
                Navigation is handled through the location's hash value, so you can directly link to any slide within a
                presentation. Note that this - again - is done by CSS only without any Javascript*.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                * Well, sort of. The ids needed as anchors are generated by Javascript.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h1>Point by point</h1>
            <p>
                Sometimes you wish several elements like list items to appear one after the other. This is easy, just add
                <code>class="increment"</code> to those elements.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="increment">This was hidden</li>
                <li class="increment">...as was this</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="increment">
                The order can be set.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="increment" data-increment="2">This comes second</li>
                <li class="increment" data-increment="1">This comes first</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Customization</h1>
            <p>
                You can create your own layouts using the <code>user.css</code> file. You can add behaviour using the
                <code>user.js</code> file. Try listening to the onhashchange event to react on switching slides.
            </p>

            <h1>Browsersupport</h1>
            <p>
                Works best in modern browsers that support the <code>vw</code>, <code>vh</code>, <code>transition</code>
                and <code>calc()</code> features of CSS. That is Android 5+, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Samsung
                Internet and more, however neither Android 4 nor Opera Mini.

            <h1>Scaling</h1>
            <p>
                The slides are automatically scaled to fit into the viewport, while maintaining an aspect ratio of 16 / 9.
                The content is scaled accordingly. Note that you have to set all dimensions in <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code>.
