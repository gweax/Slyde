            <h1>Slyde</h1>
            <p>
                Slyde is a web based presentation tool that uses advanced technologies like HTML5 and CSS3.

            <h1>Transitions</h1>
            <p>
                There are several effects to switch from one slide to another. Try changing the class name of the body
                element.
            </p>

            <h1>Transitions - CSS only</h1>
            <p>
                CSS3 is a cool way to allow for transition effects. There is no Javascript involved in that part. However,
                for more fancy effects, some Javascript might be required.
            </p>

            <h1>Navigation</h1>
            <p>
                The navigation elements on the slides are generated automatically. Therefore, you do not have to adapt every
                slide if you want to insert a new slide between existing ones.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h1>Key navigation</h1>
            <p>
                You can navigate through the slides either by using the generated link elements or by using the keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try the Page Down, Page Up, Home and End keys as well as the left and right arrow keys.
            </p>

            <h1>Linking to a specific slide</h1>
            <p>
                Navigation is handled through the location's hash value, so you can directly link to any slide within a
                presentation. Note that this - again - is done by CSS only without any Javascript.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h1>Point by point</h1>
            <p>
                Sometimes you wish several elements like list items to appear one after the other. This is easy, just add
                <code>class="increment"</code> to those elements.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="increment">This was hidden</li>
                <li class="increment">...as was this</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Browsersupport</h1>
            <p>
                Works best in Chrome and Safari. Animations are slow in Opera, but technically, it works. In Firefox 3.6
                transitions do not work for some reason. Besides, Firefox lacks some CSS3 support.
            </p>
            <p>
                It does not work in IE up to version 8. I do not care.
            </p>

            <h1>Yet to come</h1>
            <p>
                Currently, the font size is fixed. This is bad, when the browser window is small (or large). Adapting font
                size to the available space is on the to-do list.
